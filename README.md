# simple-relativistic-jet-black-hole
model radiation from black hole relativistic jet in a simple manner

simple model of relativistic jet produced by black hole.

contains:
synchrotron spectrum from electrons in jet, BLR blackbody, accretion disk, inverse compton scattering of synchrotron and BLR photons


EDIT: I just saw someone forked it.

This didn't work anywhere near as well as my uni project in python.
I believe because I'm using vectors which are not efficient to manipulate, rather than raw arrays (like I had in python with numpy).

I'm also unsure if there are any bugs because it was so slow I gave up on testing it
